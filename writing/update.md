# Status Update by Dillon Thoma and Ben Watto

For our final project, we have already completed five decisions for the user to
pick from. Each decision will lead the user down a different path of a typical day
in the life of an Allegheny Gator. The project required us to write a large number
of print line statements so far. We used if and if else statements to determine
what output is produced, based on the input given. We have worked on our final project
throughout the various lab sessions and attended TA office hours. Overall, we've
made a lot of progress, but we still want to implement more features such as an
examine option to explain more about each situation, making it more in depth, by
inputting the information from a different class. We also want to add a response
that doesn't crash the program when erroneous inputs are used. We are thinking of
using do while loops to create this., and the idea is that if you go down the wrong
path, rather than the program crashing, it will give you the option to either try
again or quit the program. Another potential implementation we have discussed is
adding an array or array list that will hold more options for more decisions, using
a different type of code than we have before. After this lab session, we are going
to meet again to create these new features.
