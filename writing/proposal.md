# Interactive Storytelling: A Day In The Life of A Gator!
## Proposal by Dillon Thoma and Ben Watto

## Abstract:
We will create a computer program that allows user input to be produced into output. The user will be given a number of options to choose from to follow a story that leads them through an adventure-style story about a day at Allegheny College. The option that the user chooses will decide the next set of options that are given, and will ultimately decide how their day goes. We plan to use conditional logic and iterations to create this program.

## Main Idea:
Our main idea for this project is to create a program that is similar to a flow chart. For example, there is a flow chart at a popular restaurant called Burgatory as you walk into the joint. It gives options such as Are you in Burgatory?, yes or no; Who are you with? granny, client, elvis, the ref, or the zamboni driver. Each different choice takes you down a different path on the flow chart. The goal of our program will be to have the user choose the correct options in the correct order, completing the program and achieving the ultimate goal of finishing a day at Allegheny. The program will take you down different paths depending on which option you choose. For example, the first scenario might be you hear your alarm going off, what do you do?: Hit snooze, or get up and take a shower? If the user chooses hit snooze, the program might take them down a path that says you slept through all your classes, and the program will end. If they choose the other option of showering, their day will continue on that path with more choices to make.

## Initial Listing of Task:
The first step for this program would be to research some similar programs we have completed earlier this year to get some ideas. Next we would implement for loops and iterators for each individual scenario that the user will face throughout their experience in the program. We would also need scanners to accept the input from the user. The last thing we would need to create is print line statements so the user can read what's happening in the terminal window while the program goes through iterations.

## Plan:
Our plan for this project is to use a similar method to lab 9, which was the Todo list. Scanners were used to allow the user to input category-search and priority-search, which then produced output based on the requested command. We would also use an iterator to cycle through the each of the options. We would also use while and if statements. As well as the else if statements to produce the desired results. To complete it we would work during the various Laboratory sessions as well as any time needed with TAs to create the functioning program we envisioned.
