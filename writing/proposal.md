Interactive Storytelling: A Day In The Life of A Gator

Abstract:
We will create a computer program that allows user input to be produced into output. The user will be given a number of options to choose from to follow a story that leads them through an adventure-style story about a day at Allegheny College. The option that the user chooses will decide the next set of options that are given, and will ultimately decide how their day goes. We plan to use conditional logic and iterations to create this program.

Main Idea:
Our main idea for this project is to create a program that is similar to a flow chart. For example, there is a flow chart at a popular restaurant called Burgatory as you walk into the joint. It gives options such as Are you in Burgatory?, yes or no; Who are you with? granny, client, elvis, the ref, or the zamboni driver. Each different choice takes you down a different path on the flow chart. The goal of our program will be to have the user choose the correct options in the correct order, completing the program and achieving the ultimate goal of finishing a day at Allegheny. The program will take you down different paths depending on which option you choose. For example, the first scenario might be you hear your alarm going off, what do you do?: Hit snooze, or get up and take a shower? If the user chooses hit snooze, the program might take them down a path that says you slept through all your classes, and the program will end. If they choose the other option of showering, their day will continue on that path with more choices to make.
