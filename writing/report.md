# Report by Dillon Thoma and Ben Watto

For this project, we wanted to make a text based adventure game. For the design, we focused on using if statements followed by if else for each set of inputs. Eventually through testing our program we noticed that when we typed in the wrong input, the program would end. We decided to use more conditional logic in a similar form as our original. Our program worked successfully and the user could travel down different paths throughout using it and the program would continue to run if they typed something incorrectly. After our demo with the TAs they suggested that we add a feature so the user can restart their choices from the beginning without having to use gradle build and gradle -q --console plain run. When implementing, we had trouble correcting out brackets, but we were able to fix them using the feature in Atom that highlights the same bracket. To evaluate our system we went down each path many times. We typed incorrect input for each decision as well as using the try again feature many times. 


Please follow the instructions in the assignment sheet as you write the final
report for this project.A detailed final project report, saved in the file writing/report.md , that documents, in a
project-specific fashion, how you designed, implemented, and evaluated your system.
