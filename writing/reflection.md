# Reflection by Dillon Thoma and Ben Watto

## Group Reflection
This lab required me to explore the real-world applications of computer science.
Please review the Laboratory Assignment Sheet and add the required details to
this paragraph.

## Dillon's Reflection
This project was extremely beneficial to my understanding of Computer Science. It
taught me how to utilize a lot of the things we learned over the course of the semester
and implement them into a real-world example of programming. This type of project that
makes us as students work through a program ourselves without a rubric or assignment
sheet to follow was helped problem solve and figure out how to be better at coding in
the Java language. However, it was also very challenging. For the most part, my partner
and I worked as a team without the assistance of TAs or others to figure out our problems.
In lab sessions, we had access to teaching assistants and Professor Kapfhammer who designed
the assignment we were doing and knew exactly how to help. In this case, each individual
group's project was different, which caused for it to be harder for people to assist.
This adversity, although challenging and sometimes stressful, ultimately increased my
knowledge of computer science by forcing me and my partner to problem solve and thing
logically about what problems we were facing, rather than just asking for guidance.
It helped me personally understand what I was typing in my source code, and understand
in greater detail why I was typing the code that I was. Overall, my partner and I
worked very well together, and spent a long period of time in the lab fixing and
improving our program until it was to the best of our abilities.

## Ben's Reflection
Overall, this project helped me to learn a lot, but it has also been very difficult.
I used the java oracle to find more information about the different things we have
implemented. We started this project focusing on if and if else statements, but
as time progressed we started to use other forms of conditional logic like while
loops. Many of the things we implemented were similar so we just had to make minor
adjustments to have to function correctly. The most difficult part of this lab was
our brackets. The whole time we had to correct them by searching for the matching
pair. After correcting those our program would run properly again. We mostly
used if and else if commands to get our program to function as we imagined. We
used the commands in a similar format, but we had to alter them slightly for
the desired results. The biggest issue we had working on this program was trying
to create an instance of a class/create an object. We followed a similar format as
the Todo lab which was similar to 'GreekFight myFight = new GreekFight();', but
we were unable to get it to function.
