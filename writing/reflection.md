# Reflection by Dillon Thoma and Ben Watto

## Group Reflection

This lab required us to explore the real-world applications of computer science.
This project was much more demanding than we originally expected, but we both learned
a lot about real-world applications. We used trial and error for a lot of the project.
We used the gradle build and the gradle run command constantly to be kept up to date
on how our program was functioning. Another real-world application we learned was
if it did not work one way, it could work another. If we could not figure it out
after that, we would assume we had made a mistake in our programming. Just from
reading the lab eleven outline, you can see the many real-world applications of
computer science. You could create a text based game like us, and even other groups
with similar topics probably approached the problem in a different manner than us.
Other topics could have been cryptology, computer graphics, or software testing.
Computer science has many options if it chosen as your career. You can apply it
however you can imagine. As for this specific project, we applied the real-world
decisions of being a student at Allegheny College, and how some people go through
their everyday life. We applied it to computer science by taking all the things
that we learned throughout the semester and put it all together into one big program.
It was amazing how much we learned in this project compared to others, as I feel
we learned more applying everything to this project than all the other labs combined!
The implementation of all the code we created was extremely beneficial to our learning
of Computer Science, and unbelievably beneficial.

## Dillon's Reflection

This project was extremely beneficial to my understanding of Computer Science.
It taught me how to utilize a lot of the things we learned over the course of the
semester and implement them into a real-world example of programming. This type
of project that makes us as students work through a program ourselves without a
rubric or assignment sheet to follow was helped problem solve and figure out how
to be better at coding in the Java language. However, it was also quite challenging.
For the most part, my partner and I worked as a team without the assistance of
TAs or others to figure out our problems. In lab sessions, we had access to teaching
assistants and Professor Kapfhammer who designed the assignment we were doing and
knew exactly how to help. In this case, each individual group's project was different,
which caused for it to be harder for people to assist. This adversity, although
challenging and sometimes stressful, ultimately increased my knowledge of computer
science by forcing me and my partner to problem solve and thing logically about
what problems we were facing, rather than just asking for guidance. It helped me
personally understand what I was typing in my source code, and understand
in greater detail why I was typing the code that I was. Overall, my partner and I
worked well together, and spent a long period of time in the lab fixing and
improving our program until it was to the best of our abilities.

## Ben's Reflection

Overall, this project helped me to learn a lot, but it has also been difficult.
I used the java oracle to find more information about the different things we have
implemented. We started this project focusing on if and if else statements, but
as time progressed we started to use other forms of conditional logic like while
loops. Many of the things we implemented were similar so we just had to make minor
adjustments to have to function correctly. The most difficult part of this lab was
our brackets. The whole time we had to correct them by searching for the matching
pair. After correcting those our program would run properly again. We mostly
used if and else if commands to get our program to function as we imagined. We
used the commands in a similar format, but we had to alter them slightly for
the desired results. The biggest issue we had working on this program was trying
to create an instance of a class/create an object. We followed a similar format as
the Todo lab which was similar to 'GreekFight myFight = new GreekFight();', but
we were unable to get it to function.
