# Reflection by Dillon Thoma and Ben Watto

This lab required me to explore the real-world applications of computer science.
Please review the Laboratory Assignment Sheet and add the required details to

Overall, this project helped me to learn a lot, but it has also been very difficult. I used the java oracle to find more information about the different things we have implemented. We started this project focusing on if and if else statements, but as time progressed we started to use other forms of conditional logic like while loops. Many of the things we implemented were similar so we just had to make minor adjustments to have to function correctly. The most difficult part of this lab was our brackets. The whole time we had to correct them by searching for the matching pair. After correcting those our program would run properly again.
